Personal sandbox!

From Nasrin:
Name of python file
Location of lambda file
handler name 

We need to get them, the name of the s3 ingestion_zone bucket!

    - variables? 
    - secrets? 


#25
+ zip up source files (maybe change to folder)
+ create S3 object in code bucket from source files

IAM

+ make a log group manually via terraform for the lambda 

- policy that will allow lambda to write to created cloudwatch log group

- policy that will allow lambda to access code bucket
    - its own folder/prefix only

- policy that will allow lambda to access ingestion bucket

- make lambda role
- attach policies to role

Lambda 

- create lambda
    - specifying S3 object in code bucket as source code
    - specify the log group
    - specify our created role
    - define lambda handler function 



#19
Add lambda permission for event bridge to run lambda on schedule
Add event bridge schedule
